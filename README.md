# Text Editor 

## Description
I refactored the starter code, so this text editor can achieve three things: 
* Can run browser
* Meets the Progressive Web Application criterias
* Can run offline
Howeveer, this application is currently having some issues. 

## Installation
This application requires a couple of dependencies installed, but running the command (npm install) on the Integrated Terminal will install all the necessary dependencies you need to run this application.
